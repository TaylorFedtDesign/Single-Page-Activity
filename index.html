          <h1>THE MYSTERY OF THE SLOTH</h1>
            <p>The sloth is quite possibly the most mysterious creature on the planet. 
              Much of this mystery has to do with their downright elusiveness. 
              There has only been one picture ever taken of a sloth, and it's on the left. 
              Don't bother googling because you won't find another.</p>
            <p>Sloth's are apex predators, with their agility and mental acuity they are unmatched by any
                other animal on the planet. Sloths have complex social structures and are known to have a rich culture,
                music and literature. Sloths are the <b>only</b> (you heard me) species on the planet to use cell phones and 
                interact with one another via the <b>World Wide Sloth Web.</b>
            </p>
            <p>If humans posessed even an iota of the sloths' abilities, it would truly be a coup for human progress.
                Alas, human beings will most likely have to learn to love our sloth overlords.
